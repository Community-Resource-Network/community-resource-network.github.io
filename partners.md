          CRN currently partners with more than a dozen Puget Sound area
          chain and independent businesses. These businesses positively
          impact the local community by granting CRN to be a conduit to the
          community, distributing items they generously and thoughtfully
          donate. Contributing partners have peace of mind to donate
          generously since the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act
          limits liability of good faith donors.<br />

          CRN has NO paid staff. Our volunteer members accomplish every task
          necessary to fulfill our purpose. This includes, but is not
          limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Processing donations<br />- Maintaining distribution sites<br />-
          Manage and administer non-profit business
        </p>
        <p>
          Our streamlined business model ensures that monetary donations are
          directed toward essential operating expenses, not salaries. We
          make the most of every dollar just as we make the most of every
          tomato, every orange, every egg, and every brussel sprout.

                  “As a recent widow I am so very thankful for the blessing
                  of food! There is no paycheck coming in anymore and
                  donations from the stores help so much. Two of my
                  neighbors are also widows. It is a joy to help them as
                  well! I am so very thankful to be a part of our team!”
