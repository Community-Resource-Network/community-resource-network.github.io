# CRN Website

## Editing the website
Do NOT edit the content in this root directory, unless you know what you are doing. This will directly edit the site code.

Instead, head over to the [/site-content/](https://github.com/Community-Resource-Network/community-resource-network.github.io/tree/master/site-content) directory, where you can find markdown files representing all of the main text content on the site.

You can edit these files, and after commiting your changes the site should update within a few minutes.
If you have any questions, feel free to [contact Kaeden](https://github.com/kaedenbrinkman).
