CRN currently partners with more than a dozen Puget Sound area chain and independent businesses. These businesses positively impact the local community by granting CRN to be a conduit to the community, distributing items they generously and thoughtfully donate. Contributing partners have peace of mind to donate generously since the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act limits liability of good faith donors.
