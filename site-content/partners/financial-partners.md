CRN has NO paid staff. Our volunteer members accomplish every task necessary to fulfill our purpose. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Processing donations
- Maintaining distribution sites
- Manage and administer non-profit business

Our streamlined business model ensures that monetary donations are directed toward essential operating expenses, not salaries. We make the most of every dollar just as we make the most of every tomato, every orange, every egg, and every brussel sprout.

Please use the button on this page to donate, knowing that we are so appreciative!
